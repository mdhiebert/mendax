Bandwidth and Sample Rate

    Sample Rate: The sample rate (-s or --sample-rate option in hackrf_transfer) is the number of samples per second. This determines the bandwidth of the signal you are capturing.

    For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 MHz (10,000,000 samples per second), you are capturing a bandwidth of 10 MHz around your center frequency. This bandwidth is symmetrically divided around the center frequency, giving you a range from (center frequency - 5 MHz) to (center frequency + 5 MHz).

    Center Frequency: The center frequency (-f or --freq option in hackrf_transfer) is the central point of the frequency band you are capturing.

Example

If you set:

    Center Frequency (-f): 100 MHz
    Sample Rate (-s): 10 MHz

Then, the bandwidth is 10 MHz, covering frequencies from 95 MHz to 105 MHz.
